This software stopped working when HFS read-only support was removed from macOS.

But there are excellent alternatives for accessing MPW from a modern computer:

EMPW (Emulated MPW) = Mini vMac + Macintosh Programmer's Workshop + glue


Requirements (install all with brew):
- hfsutils
- rsync (newer than the one shipping with macOS)
- python3


Examples:

# Enjoy an interactive MPW session in Mini vMac (kills your battery life!)
$ cd my-fancy-source-tree && empw

# Run a non-interactive MPW command and capture its standard output.
$ empw Help FileSystem

# Transfer files to the emulated MPW session.
$ echo Hello, world! > TextFile && empw Catenate TextFile
